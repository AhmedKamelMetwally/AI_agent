🚀 Project Highlight: Building an Intelligent Agent using LangChain + OpenAI + Wikipedia Tools 🤖📚

I recently built a simple yet powerful AI-powered agent using LangChain, OpenAI's GPT model, and the Wikipedia tool – and I’m excited to share a bit about it!

🧠 What Does It Do?
This project demonstrates how to create a general-purpose question-answering agent that can:

Understand natural language prompts

Access Wikipedia to gather factual information

Respond with intelligent, context-aware answers

For example:
🗨️ "What is the longest river in the world?"
🧠 → The agent thinks, searches Wikipedia if needed, and gives a coherent, researched answer — just like a human assistant would.

🔧 Tech Stack & Tools
LangChain: Framework for developing applications powered by LLMs (Large Language Models)

OpenAI (ChatGPT): Used ChatOpenAI for generating and reasoning through responses

Wikipedia Tool: A plugin that allows the agent to search and retrieve information directly from Wikipedia

Python: Core scripting language used to orchestrate the entire workflow

🛠 How It Works
The agent is initialized using ChatOpenAI as the language model.

LangChain's load_tools() loads the Wikipedia plugin.

initialize_agent() is used with ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION — enabling the agent to decide when to use external tools like Wikipedia.

The user provides a question prompt, and the agent autonomously plans and acts to deliver the best answer.

🌟 Why This Matters
AI agents like this can be used in:

Virtual assistants

Research bots

Customer support

Automated knowledge bases

And much more...

This is a small step in exploring how LLMs can be combined with real-time tools to create interactive, self-reasoning systems — a cornerstone for the future of AI applications.
